Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I 
personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II became a best seller.
Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 
original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power 
struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded 
NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him. Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, 
then $2 trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022.
