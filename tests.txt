A test or examination (exam or evaluation) is an educational assessment intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, 
or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs).
A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.

Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. There is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. 
Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, 
policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditationor governing bodies.

A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent to a child.
A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an IQ test administered by a psychologist in a clinic.
Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score. A test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both.
The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants.
