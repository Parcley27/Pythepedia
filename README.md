# Pythepedia
A Python GUI app that is a mini encyclopedia.
Current articles are sourced from Wikipedia with some additional editing mixed in.
Feel free to add more articles!

It works fine on Windows 10, I don't know about MacOS or Linux or whatever else there is.

The important files are "Pythepedia.py", "Topics.txt", and "Topics with caps.txt"
The other ones can be totally written out of the code. All the other .txt files are just the articles, with the proper spacing and formating.

Enjoy!
