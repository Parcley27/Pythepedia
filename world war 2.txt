World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of 
the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. 
In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, 
industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. 
Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war. 
World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. 
Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and 
Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders. 

The exact causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the Spanish Civil War, the Second 
Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts and rising European tensions since World War I. World War II is generally considered to have 
begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September.
