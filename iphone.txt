iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. These devices use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation of iPhone 
was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. 
As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold around the world. 

iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen. It connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls, browse the web, take pictures, 
play music and send and receive emails and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger screen sizes, 
shooting video, waterproofing, the ability to install third-party mobile apps through an app store, and many accessibility features. 
Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhone used a layout with a single button on the front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since iPhone X, 
iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with app switching activated by gesture recognition.

The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android, forming a large part of the luxury market. 
The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.
