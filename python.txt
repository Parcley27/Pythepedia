Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant 
indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, 
and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. 
Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam
and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.
